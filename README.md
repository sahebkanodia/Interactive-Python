Hi all,

I recently enrolled myself in Coursera's latest offering of "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" 
by Joe Warren, John Greiner, Stephen Wong, Scott Rixner in collaboration with RICE Univerisity.
More about the Course here : https://www.coursera.org/course/interactivepython

These are my solutions to the weekly programming assignments.
Problems could be found through this link : https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-003/human_grading/index
Although I don't know whether this link will work after the class gets over. [Let's just hope it does!]

Note:
These .py files will not run in your system. These python files have to be run in www.codeskulptor.org

Codeskulptor is a special application that has been created for the purpose of this class.

simplegui package is a package equivalent to tkinter in normal Python.

People who have knowledge of Python should probably have no problem in understanding the code.
